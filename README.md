### Hi there! üëã I'm Owen

![visitors](https://vbr.nathanchung.dev/badge?page_id=Meatball-Sub-11.Meatball-Sub-11&color=00cf00)

I'm a **Software Engineer** from the UK with a passion for building things that work well on the web. My focus often gravitates towards crafting efficient and robust backend systems, but I'm equally excited by modern web technologies. 

Right now, I'm really enjoying diving deep into **Rust** and **Axum**, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with high-performance solutions. My background in complex problem-solving from my Physics degree consistently drives my approach to developing scalable and efficient software.

### üöÄ My Toolkit

I love getting hands-on with a variety of technologies. Here's what I'm comfortable with:

* **Languages**: Python, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, R
* **Web Frameworks**: Axum, Flask
* **Frontend Magic**: Vite, React
* **Data Stores**: PostgreSQL, SQLite
* **Data Analysis & Scientific**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
* **Dev Essentials**: VS Code, Git, GitHub, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), PyCharm, WSL2, Docker, Jira, crafting great RESTful APIs, and asynchronous programming.

### üíª What's on My Workbench Right Now

* **Deltabox Store**: This is my big project at the moment ‚Äì an ambitious e-commerce platform that I'm building from the ground up with the aim of launching it as a business. It's a fantastic journey exploring a performant backend in **Rust (Axum)** and a dynamic frontend powered by **Vite**. It's all about pushing the limits of modern web development and honing my full-stack capabilities through a real-world venture.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of, they show a bit of my journey and what I can do:

* **Deltabox Store**: As mentioned, this is my current major focus and personal business venture, showcasing my approach to full-stack development with Rust/Axum and Vite. While it's currently a private repository, I'm happy to discuss the technical challenges and solutions involved!
* **[Vinted Discord Notifications](https://github.com/Meatball-Sub-11/Vinted-Discord-Notifications)**: Ever miss a deal? This Discord bot solves that! It's designed to snag real-time notifications for Vinted searches, showcasing my knack for **web scraping**, **Discord bot development**, and setting up reliable **automated tasks**.
* **[Rust Axum Auth Example](https://github.com/Meatball-Sub-11/rust-axum-auth-example)**: A hands-on Rust and Axum web app where I explore the fundamentals of **user authentication**. It demonstrates **password hashing**, effective **REST API design**, sleek **web UI rendering with Askama templates**, and even a dive into **manual SHA-256 implementation** ‚Äì great for learning purposes!
